First Page is the Signup Page.Here I have been give Validations for email,phone number and password using regular expressions.

If email,passsword,phone numbers are incorrect ,it displays a error message.

If password is not equal to confirm password ,it displays error message like password don't matched;

All the user details are stored in localstorage.

If all the details are correct,then by clicking submit button it navigates to the login page.

Here,we get the userdata from the localstorage and based on that if email and password donot matched,it shows Invalid credentials.

If email and password are correct, again we are storing the correponding data in the localstorage and by clicking on login it navigates to the user details.

Here,first we get data from localstorage and displaying user data on the User Interface.
